# Spam Email Classification

This project implements a **machine learning model** to classify emails as **spam or ham (non-spam)**. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction on email datasets.

## Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling stopwords, punctuation, tokenization).
* Text vectorization using **TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer**.
* Model training with machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.).
* Evaluation using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
* Visualization of dataset insights and model performance.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk

## Project Workflow

1. **Dataset Loading** – Import email dataset (spam/ham).
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and transform raw text into numerical form.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Apply vectorization for text representation.
4. **Model Training** – Train classification models on processed features.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Compare accuracy and performance metrics.
6. **Prediction** – Classify new/unseen emails as spam or ham.

## Results

* Achieved high classification accuracy with Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
* Demonstrated robustness in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd spam-email-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Spam\ Email\ Classification.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells to reproduce results.

## Future Enhancements

* Deploy as a **web app** using Streamlit or Flask.
* Experiment with **deep learning (LSTMs, Transformers)** for improved accuracy.
* Integrate real-time email classification.
